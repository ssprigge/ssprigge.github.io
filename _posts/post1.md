In the west (in particular US), an equilibrium that seems plausible to me is something like:
Many AI obsolesced humans in industry X (or humans that would have otherwise gone into industry X) end up as credentialed “AI Administrators” in industry X, where the position of “AI Administrator” is really just a sinecure
How this might emerge:
-Obsolesced (or soon to be) humans in an industry X,  lobby the media/govt to introduce AI oversight/safety regulations for industry X 
-Govt obliges and mandates that companies using AI, in industry X, institute departments of AI Safety, which are to be staffed by humans with requisite credentials
-Incumbent Higher Ed institutions begin offering requisite credentials for AI Safety in industry X 
-Obsolesced humans in industry X attain requisite credential for AI Safety in industry X, and then are (re)hired as “AI Administrators” in industry X 
Why it might be an equilibrium:
Sufficiently many parties are sufficiently happy
-Obsolesced workers are happy because they remain employed (often in same industry)
-Incumbent companies in industry X are happy, as AI Safety requirements provide regulatory moat
-Media/Govt are happy as regulations allow them to exert influence on industry X
-Higher Ed institutions are happy as they get to provide requisite AI Safety credentials
-Everyone else is happy as less unemployment means less unrest
