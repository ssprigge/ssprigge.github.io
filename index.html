            <p>I am in the early stages of creating an open-source database of guardrails. My plan is to traverse streets algorithmically in Google Street View, feed snapshots to GROK (or an equivalent model), and have the AI identify guardrails. The resulting data ‚Äî location, make, and condition ‚Äî would populate the database.</p>

        <p>21st-century governments face the challenge of deploying AI technologies in such a way that enhances bureaucratic legibility, transparency, and efficiency, without subsidizing bloat. In September 2023, I posted a viral x.com thread in which I investigated GPT-4 Vision's ability to parse convoluted pentagon powerpoint slides:</p>
